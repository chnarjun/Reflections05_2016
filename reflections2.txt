GIT REPOSITORY
What makes a git repository a repository is having a folder by name ".git". Since this directory has '.' at the beginning, OS knows that it should be hidden

INIT command
On your own computer if you want to make something version controlled, you will begin by running the command "git init". This command will create the ".git" directory making the parent directory a git repository

    git init

When a new repository is initialized no commits will be made. This can be verified by running git log command

STATUS command
This command will give the status of the changes/adds to your repository since last commit. 

    git status

ADD command
This command is used to add files to a staging area. This gives you flexibility to choose set of files and commit. After adding files to the staging area, you can commit only those files by running "git commit"

    git add <filename>

You can check whether the file was added or not by running the "git status" command

RESET command
If you accidentally added something to the staging area and if you wish to remove them, you need to run "git reset" command. 

    git reset

This will remove all the files added to staging area. You can check this by running "git status" command.
