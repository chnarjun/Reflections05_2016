To share and collaborate with others "github" website is used. First an empty repository has to be created by clicking the "+" icon next to username in the github website. When a new repository is created, a URL will be assigned to it. This URL is used to create "remote" on the local machine.

To keep the repositories, local and the remote, PUSH command is used. 

REMOTE REPOSITORY
It is a repository on the github website. Colloquially, this is referred to as just "remote". First a remote has to be created on local machine to push the branch to github website.

REMOTE command
This command is used to list the available remotes on your local machine.

     git remote

Also, the same command is used to create remotes. Following is the command to do so: 

     git remote add <remote_name> <url>

     Ex: git remote add origin https://github.com/username/RepoName.git

"git remote add" takes two arguments, the remote name and the remote repository URL. In the above example "origin" is the remote name and "https://github.com...." is the remote repository URL. Usually when only one remote is used and this remote is called as "origin". 

To verify whether correct remote was created, '-v' flag has to be used at the end, which prints out the remote name and the URL it is associated with. 

     git remote -v

PUSH command
Once a remote has been created, the local repository has to be "push"ed onto the remote repository. This is achieved by using the following command: 

     git push <remote_name> <branch_to_be_pushed>
     Ex: git push origin master

"git push" takes two arguments. The remote name to which a branch is being pushed and the branch name that we want to push on to the remote repository. In the above example, "master" branch is pushed onto the "origin" remote.
